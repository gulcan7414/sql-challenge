### Data Modelling, Data Engineering, Data Analysis in PgAdmin4

### Data Modelling
First of all I inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an ERD of the tables. I used this tool http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

### Data Engineering
  Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
  Convert the birth date and hire date from MM/DD/YY to YY/MM/DD format. Used Pandas for convert.
